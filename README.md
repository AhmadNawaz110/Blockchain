## Course Introduction

This course provides knowledge of the essential concepts of blockchain technology. It covers Bitcoin and Ethereum in detail, including decentralized peer-to-peer networks, immutable distributed ledgers, and the trust model that defines blockchain systems.

Students will study the components of a blockchain (transactions, blocks, block headers, and the chain), operational mechanisms (verification, validation, and consensus), and underlying algorithms. Essential trust mechanisms such as hard forks and soft forks are explained.

The course also covers hashing and cryptographic foundations indispensable to blockchain programming, forming the basis for advanced topics such as Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (DApps).
